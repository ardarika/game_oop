"""
Ð¡ontains the main game logic for a text-based RPG game.
It uses models and exceptions modules to create player and enemy objects, and handle exceptions.

The game can be played by running the 'play' function.
Players can choose their game mode (normal/hard),
enter their name, and attack and defend against enemies.
The game ends when the player's lives reach zero or the player defeats all enemies.

The following commands are available during the game: start, show scores, help and exit.

The game saves the final score of the player in a file named 'scores.txt' upon completion.

This module requires the following modules: exceptions, models, and settings.
